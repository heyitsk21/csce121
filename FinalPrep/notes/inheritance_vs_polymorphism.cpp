INHERITANCE
    * derived class: a class that is derived from another class, called a BASS CLASS (or superclass). 
      * aka a subclass
    Any class may serve as a base class. 
    The derived class is said to inherit the properties of the base class, a concept called inheritance. 
    An object declared of a derived class type has access to all the public members of the derived class as well as the public members of the base class.
      * "is-a" relationships: inheritance occurs when there is an "is-a" relationship
        * "has-a" relationships are NOT INHERITANCE
